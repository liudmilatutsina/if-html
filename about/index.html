    <h1>My way to front-end</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I've always loved design, it's always been a pleasure for me to do nice,
      comfy things. And this super fantastic feeling when you realise that
      you've done it by your own. <br />
      Of course, it wasn't connected with any development and
      <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> at all. But it was a
      starting point. <br />
      When I began to think about what I want to do in life, I've already known
      that it's going to be <em>IT sphere</em>, but what specialty - I didn't
      know, and then I started to try everything and one day i got acquainted
      with front-end. <br />
      At first, it seemed pretty easy (at least in comparison with other
      programming languages), but of course it was when I didn't get to know
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>. <br />
      But still front-end just attracted me with its diversity, ability to
      create your own pieces of code and immediately see how it's displayed on
      the page.

      Why I think I'm going to be a super front-end developer

    <p>
      1. I'm really a fast learner.<br />
      2. If something really inspires me I can quickly succeed in this.<br />
      3. I'm ready to fight with <del>evil</del> JS and defeat it.<br />
      4. I can do different tasks, even if it seems for me boring I can make it
      interesting.<br />
      5. I'm a workaholic and sometimes this quality does not work in my favor
      &#128557;.<br />
      6. I am persistent and try to solve problems till the end, so I can spend
      a lot of time, but eventually problem will be solved. <br />
      7. I consider following quote is really about me:
